# Features

## state design pattern

![](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/state/state-en-3x.png)

Thanks to a state game developed with the state design pattern, I developped a paused game mode in the tetris

but also a game over state

the runnning game turns on a state too, the running game state.
